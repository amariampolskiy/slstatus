# My personal build of [slstatus](https://tools.suckless.org/slstatus/)

Shows:
  + Upper bar
    + Battery percentage and remaining time
    + Keyboard layout
    + Date and time
  + Lower bar
    + Disk usage percentage
    + Memory usage
    + CPU usage + temperature 

P.S. Main configuration is for my thinkpad x220. There are other branches with different configs.
